# teensy_midibox

This little project of mine was intended for the following use cases:
- allow (global) transpose and octaves for my 4 synths
- note mapping between Volca sample and MPC1000
- allow saving option via sysex for my step sequencer Launchpad pro (with custom firmware "thirtytwo")
- provide midi clock to my setup

Schematics
- Fritzing file to be added
